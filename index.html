			<p class="editorial"><br>Welcome to the weather forecast. Today we will focus on contemporary visual culture and how images are changing. Today an image in circulation is less about its content then about its drive, its directions and circulation value. As the weather keeps changing they circulate from north to south. They have become as unpredictable as the weather. <br><br>Images have become as unpredictable as the weather forecast, and following this idea, the project will try to present multiple approaches to this subject compiled in a publication and on this website. The information you will see here is an extension of the contents that are written in the publication. Trough these two objects we make some predictions about the weather for tomorrow. The prediction suggests that is a chance of a coming storm for tomorrow. Don’t leave your home without an umbrella. We hope for better days soon.</p>

			<p class="text">Part of the larger Scannable Images project, the virtual installation Participatory Poverty consists of several static and animated images, along with video content and generative text superimposed upon them when viewed through the Wikitude AR browser.<br><br>
			Apart from the augmented reality components, the base layer of the installation consists of two visible objects:<br><br>
			<b>1)</b> An animated background (.gif) derived from the video experiment at the heart of this installation: "Participatory Poverty (After Hito Steyerl)". Inspired by Hito Steyerl's essay "In Defense of the Poor Image," the video draws its materials from YouTube — specifically from the search results for the term “poor image.” (See below for more information about the video.) Here, the animated gif background loops through the first few seconds of 16 of these clips.<br><br>
			<b>2)</b> A foreground image with three panels, which serves as a trigger for the installation's AR components. The three panels are:<br><br>
			a) A composited image, derived from the video "Participatory Poverty." Whereas the animated background (see above) places video clips next to another and thus suggests the contiguity between the "poor images" of YouTube and other digital video platforms, this composition layers them on top of one another, letting them impinge upon one another directly.<br>
			<b>b)</b> Another composited image of images from the video. Here again, the temporal bleeding that takes place between the various clips is translated into a spatial co-presence.<br>
			<b>c)</b> Finally, a digital photo of a canvas, 24" x 18", hand-painted by Karin Denson to depict a morphed grid of stills from the video "Participatory Poverty (after Hito Steyerl)." By painting the digital image in physical media, this work explores the interface between the imperceptible microtemporality of digital image processing (these images flash across the screen faster than they can be humanly perceived) and its transformation into a perceivable form. Moreover, the painting presents a meditation on the boundary and interaction between contemporary forms of virtuality and materiality, especially when the physical painting of a digital object/process is overlaid with an augmented layer that exists somewhere in between.<br><br>
			When scanned with the AR browser Wikitude (user's guide here), several additional components become visible (and audible):<br><br>
			<b>Your browser does not support the video tag.</b><br><br>
			<b>A)</b> The datamoshed video that forms the audiovisual core of "Participatory Poverty." This piece collects a variety of images circulating online and thinks about the status of what Hito Steyerl calls “the poor image.” Of particular interest is the conjunction of technological, political, socio-economic, and aesthetic facets, factors, and practices that Steyerl identifies in her provocative essay on the subject. Significantly, Steyerl breaks with both nostalgic or backwards-looking approaches to the “end” or “death” of cinema and with the one-sided celebration of a so-called “participatory culture,” which tends to ignore the capitalist framework within which fan-based acts of appropriation and expansion are themselves appropriated as “immaterial labor” in the service of big-business entertainment franchises. This project seeks to highlight the ambivalent status of the poor image, utilizing techniques of datamoshing and databending, themselves fan-based techniques for image impoverishment that have also been employed in high-profile projects (e.g. big-budget music videos) and projects with a high-cultural cachet (e.g. gallery art). In order to question the confluence of technical and socio-economic/political considerations at work in the poor image while avoiding too much editorial interference or interpretation on our part, the video works generatively — drawing materials from YouTube and collating them according to the itinerary dictated by the search results for the term “poor image.” That is, the first 44 search results (from a query conducted on April 8, 2015) are cycled three times, in the order of their appearance in the list of results — initially taking the first ten seconds of each clip, then the next five, and finally the next second. After combining the images, in this order, all I-frames were removed (so-called “datamoshing”), thus establishing unexpected — and, we think, interesting and sometimes telling — connections between the clips.<br>
			Participatory Poverty is part of a post-attention economy.<br><br>
			<b>B)</b> An HTML overlay displaying stills from the video, along with randomly selected statements about "Participatory Poverty" — what it is, what it wants, what it thinks, hopes, or fears.<br>
			Hito Steyerl: you, and non-commercial imagery, also possibly creates a decoy, 2008. The contemporary imperfect cinema as a network of being just downloads: its next life in motion.<br><br>
			<b>C)</b> Another HTML overlay, which digitally morphs the physical painting back into a grid of images and morphs each video still into the next. The text overlay uses Markov chains to randomly generate sentences on the basis of Hito Steyerl's "In Defense of the Poor Image," which theorizes the interconnection of material-technological and economic-political facets of what she calls the poor image. The associative logic of the text-generating algorithm formally mimics the logic of contiguity and promiscuous interconnection by which post-cinema operates, and according to which it distinguishes itself from the human-centered perceptual logic of classical cinema. And it is these dynamics that we hope to capture and mediate — both thematically and materially — to the viewer of "Participatory Poverty" and the larger project of "Scannable Images.”<br><br>

			<p class="project">FAREWELL PHOTOGRAPHY <span style="font-size: 0.7em;"> by Boaz Levin (2017).</span></p><br><br><br>
			<p class="text">More than one hundred fifty years after its invention, photography’s presence in the political sphere is today as contentious as ever. Its unique ability not only to render people and places beyond our immediate experience visible, but also to lend them new meaning, has often placed photography at the heart of political debates. Still images are better retained by memory, and despite the omnipresence of instantaneous “live” video documenta­tion, iconic images—images that circulate extensively whose maurk remains etched in our collective memory—are more likely to be still photographs. Since it first emerged, photography has been either heralded for its emancipatory and civic potential—it’s capacity, in the words of nine­teenth ­century abolitionist Frederick Douglass, to enable “men of all conditions [to] see themselves as others see them”—or derided and criticised as manipulative, crude and objectifying, as a mechanism of control, surveillance, and classification. At the advent of the digital age, the expanding scope, breadth and speed of image dissemina­tion has made the question of navigating their political potential and shortcomings all the more urgent, and the stakes increasingly higher.
			<br><br>It is such contradictions and tensions that are explored within “Resisting Images”. The exhibition brings together a range of works operating at the frayed edges of docu­mentary practices, and at the front of the politics of repres­entation. As its title suggests, the works in the exhibition address this ambivalence within an image­s saturated present, that is: they look at images both as a means of resistance and as a mode of control to resist against, a unique sort of pharmakon, a poison and a remedy.<br><br>

			<p class="project">PUBLIC ACCESS <span style="font-size: 0.7em;"> by David Horvitz and Ed Steck (2009—2010).</span></p><br><br><br>
			<p class="text">In late December of 2010 and early January of 2011, I drove the entire California Coast from south to north. The trip started at the Mexican Border at Border Field State Park and ended at Pelican State Beach on the Oregon border. The drive covered the entirety of California's Highway 1, also known as the Pacific Coast Highway. I stopped at about 50 different coastal access points along the trip. At these locations I made photographs of the view of the Pacific Ocean. Sometimes inconspicuously, and sometimes conspicuously, I stood within the frame of the photograph. All of them I faced towards the ocean, away from the camera, so that the photograph was not necessarily about me, but that it would seem that I just happened to be in the photograph. All of these images were then placed onto the Wikipedia articles about the different locations.
			<br><br>Some articles already had images, in which I added mine to them. Others, for the more remote locations, were image-less, with only a few lines of text describing the beach. The intent was that these images would begin to circulate in this public place as visual information surrounding the geographic location, as a kind of metadata for the locations. 		
			<br><br>Another thought that emerged from this project was a play between the ideas of omnipresence and remoteness. There is an omnipresence to the internet. It is a site of the instantaneous flowing of information between different locations. Some of the locations I ventured to were remote. They were out of cellphone signal, away from cities, and sometimes even miles from highways. They were accessible, but took effort to get there. In a sense, I was going offline, only to bring these images back online with me.
			<br><br>But also, placing the images right back in another remote location, lost somewhere in the vastness of the internet. Not long after I posted them, some people caught on and recognized that my IP address was producing similar content for different articles. Various conversations emerged within Wikipedia by different users, debating what to do, and if any policy was actually being broken. Within a few weeks, all of the photographs had been removed from the articles, and deleted from the server.
			<br><br>I recently asked my mother if she could tell me a memory from her childhood of a California Beach. She had lived in Los Angeles her whole life. Her mother, my grandmother, had lived in California her entire life (except for those few years in a Japanese Internment Camp in Granada, Colorado). My mother told me that the family used to take daytrips in the summer out to Point Dume in Malibu. On one trip, a relative buried a watermelon in the wet sand to cool it down. Some hours later when everyone was ready to eat the water- melon, the relative went to dig it up. When he returned to the area it was buried, he found that the stick that marked its exact location had been washed away with the waves. No one was able to find where the watermelon was buried. When I think about this memory I imagine a group of first, second, and third generation Japanese-Americans hopelessly digging holes in the sand trying to uncover the fruit to no avail. They left that evening, leaving it buried somewhere in the sand.

			<p class="project">David Horvitz: Becoming a Stock Image, <br>and other Surrogates for the Online Self. <span style="font-size: 0.7em;"> by Kate Palmer Albers (2016).</span></p><br><br><br>
			<p class="text">Isur&#8226;ro&#8226;go&#8226;gate
							<br>/ˈsərəɡət,ˈsərəˌɡāt/ 
							<br>noun
							<br>noun: surrogate; plural noun: surrogates
							<br>1. a substitute, especially a person deputizing for another in a specific role or office.<br><br>
							<br><b>1.</b><br><br>
								A year or so ago, a colleague of mine—let’s call her Jane—told me how much she disliked the first photograph that appeared with a Google image search of her name. I didn’t know what photograph she was objecting to so strongly, but I knew the feeling she meant. With images both of oneself and one’s professional activities and interests collected through a variety of  means—including direct tags, shared appearances on websites, and public archives of social media posts—it can be unnerving to confront the algorithmically constructed photo album  of our online existence. Without the editorial control we may be used to in other forms of both private and public image management, Google image search results dispassionately proclaim, “this is what you look like in public, online.”
								<br><br>Because Jane has professional interests in privacy and consciously cultivates a very light online footprint, rather than live with the slight unease caused by coming eye to eye with the accumulated presence of her online image, she gave herself a project. Her goal was to get the offending image removed from the search results. Though motivated by a substantial desire for online privacy, the pursuit—she readily admits—existed somewhere at the intersection of professional curiosity and personal vanity. Because the original image had multiplied online and appeared in at least three locations, their removal entailed contacting an international array of webmasters at multiple companies, and ultimately filing an image copyright claim with Google, which asserted the photographer’s right over the image (not, ironically, her own). Perhaps her greatest challenge was in seeing that her photograph had also been transferred to another person’s identity, a woman in eastern Europe who, for unknown reasons, was using it as her own profile image.
								<br><br><b>2.</b>
								<br><br>I found myself equally interested a number of questions raised by Jane’s reaction and responses, including 1) any individual’s desire or ability to manage self-image in an online public space—as opposed to a traditional public space, 2) the easy multiplication and spread of images, from one context to the next, and the corresponding difficulty of stopping that spread or removing the image entirely 3) the relationship between algorithms and people selecting a group of images, and 4) public access to the private self.
								<br><br>The easy and fluid movement of images online, from one immaterial context to another, can be seen, depending on one’s perspective, as either a utopian space offering infinite contextual flexibility, or a landmine-strewn field of copyright threats and complications. It is more common to see artists’ concern about the (perhaps alarmingly) freewheeling movement of authored images through this often undifferentiated series of spaces than it is to see artwork that engages seriously with the new realities and creative possibilities of that movement. And yet, how we, as a culture, come to understand these new types of image relationships within such emerging arenas of visual consumption and forms of visual display relates closely to the broad challenge of navigating ourselves through the shifting—and perhaps unfamiliar—terrain of online public space.
								<br><br><b>3.</b>
								<br><br>In 2014, the artist David Horvitz made a photograph of himself portraying a visual stereotype of internal despair. The resulting image is simultaneously evocative of both a legacy of conceptual art and the banalities of stock  photography. In the former category, Horvitz summons his conceptual forebearer Bas Jan Ader’s most well- known piece, I’m Too Sad To Tell You (1970-1971), a video of the artist weeping, conveying the incommensurable space between sorrow and speech. But unlike Ader’s direct confessional, which strikes a heartfelt tone, Horvitz obscured his own face, making his self  anonymous, and built in the visual clichés of depression: a lone male figure, dressed in black, lowered head-in-hands, a tumultuous sea behind him. Having created an image suitable for the generic needs of those wishing to visually signal “inner turmoil”, Horvitz uploaded the image to Wikimedia Commons—a growing database of, at present, 31,595,596 freely usable media files to which anyone can contribute—and then linked that image to the Wikipedia page for Mood Disorder, an overarching psychological diagnosis classification, the most common of which is clinically diagnosed depression. (A more accurate image for this page would no doubt be a person of perfectly average appearance, but that’s a separate matter.)
								<br><br>Safely categorized as fair use and with no fees to anyone who wished to take it, Horvitz’s uploaded image followed the laws of online nature and, over time, circulated—or, “propogated,” to use Horvitz’s term—away from the Wikipedia page and became absorbed into new contexts. As Horvitz had observed in a previous project, “My photographs depict my own presence in a place and are intended to move, to circulate, to be sourced and re-sourced. Like the postcard, the digital photograph is meant to embark on its own travel. Instead of a singular object moving through time and space, its movement is defined by multiplication through copying, re-posting, forwarding, etc.”
								<br><br>Horvitz’s challenge then became tracking the image—a surprisingly elusive task given the ubiquity of images online. Whether archives of material objects or networks of jpegs circulating online, large image collection sites challenge easy access for all but the most iconic of images. Though the image depicts Horvitz, it was not identified with his name. This disassociation meant that the easiest textual search term, “David Horvitz” was ineffective in tracking the image’s movement.
								<br><br>It was a situation curiously opposite the one experienced by my colleague who didn’t like her Google search results: where she objected to the image (of  herself) that the search algorithm produced as a match for her name in text form, and wanted the terms disassociated, Horvitz, by contrast, sought to create a condition whereby his own image (made anonymous) would travel freely through online space. Yet, now disassociated from the search term of  his name, tracking the proliferation of the image had to be determined through a reverse image search, a still-rudimentary process of algorithmic vision that attempts both to replicate a human’s ability to differentiate among like visual forms and recognize individual forms or places within those broader categories. the results of this search became Horvitz’s book, Mood Disorder.
								<br><br><b>4.</b>
								<br><br>My first introduction to Horvitz was through an online search, in 2012, when a friend of a friend suggested I might be interested in his work. I looked him up, and while I must have found his website, all I remember from that first search is his Wikipedia page, where I was curious to find a number of  obvious irregularities for a typical artist’s biography. I was interested enough in that fact alone to check back on the page, and found that every time I looked, it had changed in some puzzling way—never quite what I remembered, but also never quite seeming like a usual, or accurate, artist’s profile. So it seemed not entirely surprising to learn, in July 2014, that Horvitz had been banned from Wikipedia, after extensive, and now archived, discussion among Wikipedia editors largely stemming from unusual activity on the artist’s Wikipedia profile and his performance/intervention Public Access, and coalescing around the “Mood Disorder” image, which was deemed, in short, inappropriate self-promotion at odds with the goals of Wikipedia. Consequently, Horvitz’s man-and-the-sea (self-)image was removed from the “Mood Disorder” page, and Horvitz himself was indefinitely banned from Wikipedia, which is actually to say that the name “David Horvitz” along with its associated username and IP address, was prohibited from editing Wikipedia entries. In the material world, an act of “banning” conjures legal action such as a restraining order, whereby the person’s physical body is barred from entry into the designated parameters of a particular physical space, or must keep a particular physical distance from another person, both acts that would generally be prevented or surveilled through traditional visual means: the eyes of cameras, guards, or other interested parties. Yet to “ban” someone digitally is necessarily premised on establishing personhood through other categories. Horvitz was not banned from physically walking into Wikipedia headquarters in San Francisco. However, the digital extension of him, his online and immaterial surrogate, as expressed through a configuration of words, place and source code, is not welcome in that online space.
								<br><br><b>5.</b>
								<br><br>And yet, despite his ostensible absence, Horvitz manages to perpetuate a degree of uncertainty. In the course of trying to determine which, if any, of  the other Wikipedia editors who had become involved in images and edits was associated with Horvitz (one of them, for instance, shares his name, but is not thought to be him), one of his most vocal dissenters wrote in apparent frustration, in July 2014, “I’m simply doubting that if it’s even the right person. There’s no telling with this guy.”—Ryūlóng (琉竜) 13:44, 13 July 2014 (UTC) I could relate. In my own online sleuthing trying to understand for myself the circulatory patterns of the “Mood Disorder” image, I came to feel a lot like I imagined the befuddled yet persistent Wikipedia editors who were discussing his case to be. By way of example, I came across two other photographs that struck me as potentially “authored” by Horvitz, on some level, if only as existing, by virtue of his connection, within the same image sphere. The first was another photograph of a crashing ocean, in a book by yet another (?) David Horvitz, that appeared on his Instagram feed, and the second is the current (as of this writing) image on the Wikipedia page for Mood Disorder: an 1869 illustration of a man standing by himself in the rain that already, 150 years ago, oozed self-awareness about its own status as visual cliché, a tongue-in-cheek “stock image” of its day.
								<br><br>Drawing on essentially the same visual stereotypes as Horvitz, instead of the lowered-head-in-hands gesture it features a visage obscured by a rain hat and umbrella and swaps out the trope of crashing waves for the pathetic fallacy of  a heavy downpour to indicate human emotion. The illustration, published in 1869 in the satirical magazine Punch, was captioned to indicate its own absurdity as a serious image.
								<br><br>Whether or not Horvitz uploaded this image as well hardly matters: the more interesting point is that I wondered if he had, if the man standing in the pouring rain could be a surrogate image for the first, now removed, crashing wave image. The idea of a surrogate for an imposter stock image is funny, or at least absurd (and so meta it hurts), but if the strategy of hiding in plain sight fails, it is a reasonable (if also funny and absurd) extension of the same impulse.
								<br><br><b>6.</b>
								<br><br>It is worth noting that the offending “Mood Disorder” photograph is archived on the website’s editorial talk boards. So, too, for that matter, is Horvitz’s expressed wish to delete his own Wikipedia page—a wish that has been commemorated in the form of a fixed material life by the designer Sabrina Montimurro, working with Paul Soulellis.
								<br><br>* Sabrina Montimurro, "Deleting David Horvitz," 2015 
								<br><br>Horvitz more closely shares the goal of erasure with my colleague who worked to get her “bad” photograph removed from public online space. the dificulty of the two projects, and the diferences between them, however, illuminate the complexity of online privacy rights for individuals and for individuals who also exist as public figures. In Horvitz’s case, as an individual, he can aesthetically disrupt the typical circuitry of public knowledge production on a site like Wikipedia, in a manner that directs his audience to consider the parameters and possibilities of such an interface, but as a figure about whom a Wikipedia page exists, a page that is written by other people on the basis of previously published information, Horvitz can do relatively little to control the narrative.
								<br><br>In the face of the durability of online data, then, the existence of a public surrogate or, better yet, a band of surrogates all slightly different from one another, to act as a collective form of decoy, becomes an appealing possibility. It is a strategy not unrelated to that practiced by the artist Hasan Elahi, who, since 2003, has been making the aesthetic and political point that a torrential deluge of information—photographs, coordinates, records—is not unlike no information at all. Tis mirrors the proposals of some online privacy advocates: in the absence of the possibility of the total erasure of an online identity, adding data, and particularly misinformation, rather than subtracting it is a viable alternative.
								<br><br>Of course, Horvitz and Elahi are artists, so ultimately, if known, their gestures of anonymity bolster their own aesthetic authorship, refracting back though the multiplicity of online space to coalesce around their professional identities. In Horvitz’s case, for example, the image that was set free through its Wikimedia Commons status, was reconstituted in all of its new permutations at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, an institution nearly synonymous with aesthetic authorship. Fittingly, at the close of the exhibition, Horvitz gave away the exhibited copies of Mood Disorder to friends and strangers, setting them back into unknown paths of circulation.<br><br>

			<p class="project">AI HAS CREATED SOME CREEPY BUT KIND <br>OF BEAUTIFUL NUDE ART. <span style="font-size: 0.7em;"> by Anna Cafolla (2018).</span></p><br><br><br>
			<p class="text">Nude portraiture at its best is personal, intimate, and confronting – sensuous Klimt, the fascinating cubism of Duchamp, Tom Wesselmann’s explicit, technicolour American nude, the impactful black beauty of Mickalene Thomas. As artificial intelligence has had a crack at just about everything else – from existential memes to the more disturbing fake porn – a neural network has been trained to produce its own take on nude art. 
			<br><br>Robbie Barrat, self-taught in both AI and art, is a recent high school graduate from West Virginia that created and trained the neural network. Now based in San Francisco, he’s been working on AI for NVIDIA’s self driving cars. The company first heard about him from his other popular project, which taught AI to rap like Kanye West.
			<br><br>“I really think that AI-created art is going to be one of the major upcoming art movements in the near future,” he tells Dazed. “The idea of using AI as a tool to create art is different than nearly all generative art done on computers before.”
			<br><br>To start, Barret fed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) thousands of nude portraits from across different centuries and strains of art. “Basically what happens is you train the GAN to take in random vectors (lists of numbers), and output portraits,” he explains. Two neural networks, a discriminator and the generator, work in tandem. “The generator comes up with paintings that fool the discriminator, and the discriminator tries to learn how to tell the difference between real paintings from the dataset and fake paintings the generator feeds it.”
			<br><br>Though they get better at doing what they’re programmed to do over time, producing in this case more realistic portraits, sometimes they fall into what Barrat calls a “local minima”. This means they find a way to keep fooling each other without getting better at the task.
			<br><br>“In this case,” he says, “the generator keeps generating fleshy blobs that fool the discriminator pretty well, so overall they stop getting better at painting.”
			<br><br>The results are bizarre and abstract moments of flesh and blob, as AI reinterprets classical nude art into something halfway between fascinating and creepy. Barrat compares AI-assisted art with the work of conceptual artist Sol LeWitt and his digital generative art. In the 70s, LeWitt offered a set of rules for a drawing, that he would then send to a museum for others to interpret and create there. This instruction-based art produced a wide range of work, from geometric shapes to detailed line drawings that took days and weeks to create.
			<br><br>“While his artwork was still rule based, room for interpretation of the rules is still there, just like in my AI assisted artwork, but completely unlike what happens in more traditional rule-based generative art,” adds Barrat.
			<br><br>He believes that AI-generated art is going to be integral for moving art forward, and could forge its own movement entirely. We have, in fact, already seen an appetite for AI-produced art – at Art Basel, spectators in the majority unknowingly preferred AI art over real life artists. However, this project presents a totally new idea – where a machine creates original content, rather than just interpreting rules.
			<br><br>Barret says he’s happy with the more surreal and strange outcomes, rather than perfectly generated portraits. “I want to get AI to generate new types of art we haven't seen before; not force some human perspective on it,” he says. “If the resulting images were realistic nude portraits; it wouldn't be nearly as exciting as the strange and alien bags of meat it paints.” 
			<br><br>Building on this new, exciting, strange art movement, Barrat believes AI has an eye on future art humans don’t have: “I want to use AI to make its own new and original artworks, not just get AI to mimic things that people were making in the 1600s.”<br><br>
